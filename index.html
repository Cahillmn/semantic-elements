    <p>Semantic tags define the function and the category of your text, simplifying the work for browsers and search
        engines. It also makes it easier to read for developers. Semantics also helps with accessibility, searchability,
        internalization and other programmers to understand the structure of your webpage. Examples of semantic elements
        are header, footer, and article. div and span are not considered semantic.</p>

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
        Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
